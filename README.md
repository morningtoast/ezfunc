## History

I created this framework back in 2004 and it has become a standard include
in my PHP build stack ever since. Newer versions of PHP have native functions that
does the work of soem of these helpers but there shouldn't be any conflicts.

I haven't updated this framework in quite some time but that's not to say this
framework is no longer supported or updated...there just hasn't been a need to
add any new functions to it.
